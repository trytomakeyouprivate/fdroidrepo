# F-Droid-repo-for-patched-proprietary-apps
A lot of apps with great features, that normally track the users. They have no FOSS equivalent, so they mostly have removed internet permissions and work fine without any privacy problems.

DISCLAIMER: I had no time for this project since quite a while, as apart from Spotify I just dont use non-FOSS apps with internet access. I used LuckyPatcher to edit permissions, seems totally legit but no fun to have this app on your rooted phone and pretty intransparent.

I am happy about help doing that manually.

## Offline patched apps

I use GrapheneOS nowadays. There, and on LineageOS, DivestOS and CalyxOS too, you have a permission toggle to disable Internet access for apps.

But if you are on Stock Android you have to install apps with the Internet permission disabled in the APK.

## Modified apps

These are actually the more nessecary changes in apps, as you can manually disable actions and permissions of apps.

permissions:
- Start on boot
- access sensors
- and a lot more

activities
- facebook
- adobe
- google ads
- looots of other ad and tracking providers

These are the more important apps that actually need to be patched. I got Spotify to work, but not the newest version, already using some weird Lucky Patcher settings that fake existence of something.
